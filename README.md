# Data Structures in C for First-Year Engineering (Mumbai University)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the Data Structures in C repository! This resource is specifically designed for first-year engineering students studying under the Mumbai University syllabus. The repository contains well-structured C programs that cover fundamental data structures, along with comments and explanations to help students learn effectively.

About the Repository
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository includes:
1.Implementation of core data structures in C.
2.Programs designed as per the Mumbai University syllabus for first-year students.
3.Beginner-friendly explanations and comments for better understanding.
4.Sample input/output for each program.

The repository is maintained by Pratik Zinjad, Teaching Assistant at Saraswati College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai, to assist students in learning and applying data structures concepts effectively.
